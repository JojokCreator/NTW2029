#### What to know before asking for recommendations

- This guide assumes that you are asking for recommendations from former professors/instructors; similar principles apply to other supervisory/employment relationships.
- Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, providing a "recommendation" for someone is often different than acting as a "reference". You should understand the differences.
	- Recommendation: sometimes a key part of the application process is getting written recommendations that are submitted with the other application materials. The recommendations are read in the context of other applicants' recommendations, all of which will be positive, so the bar for how good a recommendation must be in order to help you is quite high. Writing a recommendation is hard. You are asking for a big, time-consuming favor from a very busy person who will receive nothing other than the mental benefit of helping someone else. Be appreciative and deferential.
	- Reference: sometimes a potential employer/institution will decide to hire/accept someone and wants to make sure that the person is as they appear. They want to confirm their decision and avoid problematic personalities, but the decision has essentially been made and is just being confirmed. They ask for people whom they can contact as a reference. Those people do not have to provide a written recommendation in advance but will respond to an employer's email or phone call and answer questions. This role is less burdensome on the reference and you don't need to be as careful about this as long as you have a good relationship with the person.
- Who should you ask?
	- Don't choose people based only on personality. Nice people may not be able to give you the best recommendations even if you feel most comfortable approaching them.
	- Do not ask for a recommendation from someone if you have not completed an entire course with them (i.e. don't ask in the middle of the semester unless you have already taken another course with them).
	- If possible, do not ask for a recommendation from someone if you did not get an A or A- in the course. You want your recommender to be able to say, at a minimum, that you were one of the top students in the class or section.
- You should make clear that you only want a recommendation if they will give you a very positive one
	- Recommendations that are generally positive, but are not enthusiastic, will usually hurt your application
	- You can ask them this directly: "Do you think you would be able to write me an extremely positive recommendation?" or "Would you be comfortable enthusiastically recommending me for the program?"
- Give them a face-saving way to say "no" so you can avoid getting a lukewarm recommendation. It is very uncomfortable to tell someone that you will not recommend them, and some people will agree to write it just to avoid that awkwardness. I recommend asking over email so they can say no more easily.
	- "If you do not think you know my work well enough to write a recommendation, of course I understand."
	- "I know you are busy, so I understand if you cannot realistically find time to do this."
	- If they are not very positive about you, you want them to say noâ€”making it easy for them to do so is your best way to find out who will write a good recommendation.
- If they agree to provide the recommendation, make the process as easy as possible for them
	- Provide deadline information. Recommenders expect you to give them four weeks' notice. If you can't do that, give as much time as you can.
	- Ask if there is anything they would like you to do to make it easier for them to write the recommendation.
	- Remind them about the recommendation one week in advance of the deadline.
	- One day before the deadline, if they have not told you that they sent it, confirm that they have sent or will send the recommendation.
	- Tell them how they should provide the recommendation logistically (website link, email address, etc.). If you will give their email for the request, ask which email address they prefer you provide.
	- In the unlikely event that they have to send the recommendation through the mail, if possible, give them pre-addressed, stamped envelopes.
- Give them material to help them write the recommendation, including:
	- detailed information about what you are applying for, including information about the school, program, scholarship, and/or any decision criteria for the application
	- your application personal statement and/or a summary of how you are presenting yourself to the application committee
	- reminders of anything about you that they might use in their recommendation, including what classes of theirs you were in and any assignments that you did
		- include detailed examples if possible, such as what you wrote your paper about
		- if they gave you good comments on an assignment, remind them what the comments were or give them a softcopy of the assignment with comments
- If you do well in a course and think you would like to use the instructor for a recommendation sometime in the future, but don't need one now, after you have received your final grade, ask them if they would be willing to write you a recommendation sometime in the future, if needed. Stay in touch with anyone you think you might use as a recommender in future years and keep them updated on your progress.
- The seniority or title of a recommender is considered by the selection committee, but is less important than the strength/detail of the recommendation.
