## Class feedback

Every student will [:anonymously](#x-anonymous) post questions, comments, and feedback after every class meeting. You will do this on the Canvas "Discussions" page, using a separate thread for each meeting. I will respond in these threads, and you are encouraged to post replies or follow-up questions to anyone's posts.

Students are expected to [:read all posts](/ntw2029/courses/policies/tech-guidelines/#canvas) on the discussion forums, as my responses often contain important clarifications or information.

## Other discussions

I'll create threads for a few other topics. I encourage you to ask questions and I'll do my best to respond. [:Email me](/ntw2029/courses/policies/tech-guidelines/#course-email) if I haven't responded to your question within 24 hours.

# :x anonymous

Canvas just added the option for anonymous posting in Summer 2024. I prefer allowing anonymity so the feedback is more honest and useful. However, please keep your feedback in the same respectful tone you would want me to use when giving you feedback on your assignments.

Also, please don't use anonymity as an excuse to skip giving feedback. If I don't regularly receive feedback from all students, I will feel forced to remove the option for anonymity.

# :x Forum post assignments

I sometimes create assignments to post on our class forum. I will create separate discussion threads for these assignments. You should post directly to the forum, not as a submission on the assignment page.

For each assignment, you will make a first post on the assigned topic and at least one additional post in reply to a classmate's first post. The topic of your posts will be specified in each assignment.

General requirements of these assignments are:

- posts should not be a stream of loosely related thoughts; focus on one main idea per post
- posts should be written in full, grammatical sentences in the style of a formal email, not like a text message or social media comment
- I encourage you to add questions to your post that you would like classmates to answer (questions do not have to be on the same topic as the main idea of your post)
- first posts should be at least 150 words; responses to other students should be at least 100 words
- be respectfulâ€”don't say anything that you wouldn't say directly to someone during class discussion
- you are encouraged to challenge ideas that you disagree with, including mine, and please do so politely and provide reasons for your disagreement

Forum post assignments are designed to take 30 min or less to read/watch/engage with material relevant to the post and an additional 30 min or less to complete all posts. Don't spend more than 90 min total on any one forum post assignment.

Your first post will be due one day before your reply post is due. Unless otherwise stated, all assignments are due at 11:59pm.

Although you should post directly to the forum, as I try out this new method, please help me balance student workload by posting data collection information as a submission on the assignment page. Tell me how long it took you for your first post and how long you spend on the assignment as a whole (including reading other posts and making all of your posts related to the assignment).
