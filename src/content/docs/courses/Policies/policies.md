# Attendance

- Consistent class attendance is required. I will know everyone in class by name and your absences will be noticed.
- Attendance will be recorded with a sign-up sheet and you must sign it to get credit for attending class. Don't forget to sign it if you are late!
- I understand that sometimes emergencies happen that may force you to miss class. Please email me to explain in these situations.
- Any absences over 2 will reduce your final grade by one letter grade, so do not miss class unless you really cannot avoid it. If you skip class because you want to catch up on sleep or finish an assignment for another class, and you later have an emergency, you will regret your earlier decision. (Exceptions to the grade penalty can be granted in truly extraordinary cases.)
- If you miss class, get notes from a classmate and then email me if you still have specific questions or need something I handed out in class.
- If you cannot attend class but want to participate via video chat, you may ask a friend to help you call in on a laptop or tablet.

# Electronics Policy

- This courses aims to discuss big, complicated ideas, which requires a different sort of focus than many other courses. It is a sort of focus that is easily disrupted by electronic devices, which promise to have the answers you want just one web search away (even though they usually don't). To reduce the temptation to stop thinking for yourself and to start searching for the answers elsewhere, I do not allow electronic devices (phones, laptops, tablets, etc.) to be used during class for any reason except to accommodate for a disability. If you have a disability and would like accommodation, let me know during the first week of class.
- Please have all phones and laptops put away and out of sight in your pocket or bag, not on the table. If you have a reason that you must have your phone out during class (e.g. your family member is extremely sick and you are waiting for an emergency text) let me know in advance so I know why you have it out.
- I will provide printed notes for each class, and you will take handwritten notes on these handouts or your own paper. Thus, you will not miss anything important even if you are used to taking notes on a laptop.

# Food & Drink

- Drinks during class are fine, but please do not eat anything in the classroom.

# Talking in class

- I love it when students talk in class to ask questions or as part of the class discussion.
- I get _very distracted_ when students talk quietly to their nearby classmates, because I think that they are confused about something I said, and I start thinking about what might have confused them, and then I wonder if I confused everyone, and then class discussion suffers. Please, just raise your hand and ask me to repeat myself.

# Feedback and Course Improvement

- My teaching approach includes the idea that I should always strive to find ways to improve my course and teaching effectiveness so students learn as much as possible and that both students and teachers enjoy the process.
- One thing experience has taught me is that every group of students is different enough that my teaching techniques and course design must be continuously revised to best meet the needs of any particular group of students. Towards this end, I'm going to be asking each of you to invest some small effort in helping me gather information I can use to improve the course.
