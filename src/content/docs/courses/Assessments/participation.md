Your class participation grade is based on your level of positive engagement with the class.
</summary>

- If you attend regularly, pay attention, ask questions, answer course emails promptly, bring your materials to class, and see me in office hours, your grade goes up.
- If you miss class, chat with other students during lecture/discussion, sleep, frequently arrive late, and don't ask or answer questions (in or out of class), your grade goes down.
- Most students meet the baseline expectation: they attend almost all classes, answer emails promptly, bring their materials to class, and pay attention. If you do this and also sometimes speak in class, you will get an average grade. If you exceed the baseline, you will get an above average grade. If you fail to meet the baseline (rarely speak, often tardy, miss classes, come unprepared), you will get a below average grade.
- Your participation grade does not depend on saying only things that are correct. I consider asking clarifying questions or suggesting answers that turn out to be wrong to be just as important as contributing new ideas and suggesting answers that turn out to be right.
- Actively listening to others is an important part of participating in discussion. Class discussions should not be competitive, with students striving to answer the most questions correctly. I am much more interested in whether the class as a whole develops a dialog that moves our understanding forward, and listening to others and asking clarifying questions is essential to that goal.
- One aspect of class participation is providing feedback to me about the course. At the end of every class, I will ask you to post questions or comments about anything we discussed in class that day. You can take this opportunity to provide me feedback about the course and my teaching to help me make continuous improvement.

<summary> Shy students can still get a good class participation grade

- You can make up for not speaking in class by showing me your engagement in other ways, such as posting to the discussion boards, talking with me outside of class, or emailing me interesting links and resources relevant to the course.
- I observe your contributions to small group discussions, not just whole-class discussions, and those count towards participation as well.
