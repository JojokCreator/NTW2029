<details><summary> Students will have regular, short, "low-stakes" exercises</summary>

- Since the most effective way to improve writing is through frequent practice, students will regularly be asked to submit short written assignments called "exercises" for class
- Exercises may include:
  - Posts on the Canvas "Discussion" pages
  - Short assignments individually submitted on Canvas (these may be handed out and discussed in class)
- Exercises are "low-stakes" in that individual exercises are each a small portion of your final grade and they are intended more as writing practice than a final, polished product
- I expect that you will not fully understand the readings before class discussion, and you will sometimes have to write exercises about the readings without fully understanding them to build your reading and writing skills

</details>

<details><summary> Exercises are each graded credit/no credit based on simple criteria</summary>

- Exercises will get full marks if they are:
	- submitted on time
	- reflect appropriate effort
	- output matches assignment (i.e. you carefully read the exercise and did what was asked)
	- correct logistics (formatting, submitted in the right place, included all requested information, etc.)

</details>

<details><summary> Write exercises with a focus on simple language and clear communication</summary>

- Even though exercises are low-stakes writing, they should be written grammatically, in full sentences (not bullet points), and in academic style (not text message or personal reflection style)
- Write grammatically so I know that any writing errors are not due to carelessness or low effort
- Write with a focus on simple language and do NOT try to impress me or your classmates with your big vocabulary. It often backfiresâ€”you use the word in a close-but-not-quite-right way and fail to communicate your ideas effectively, which is the main purpose of academic writing.

</details>

<details><summary> Exercises are neither formal papers nor reflection papers</summary>

- For exercises:
	- Do not cite or quote sources unless the assignment explicitly tells you to.
	- Do not do any outside research for the assignments. Exercises should reflect your ideas; they are not research assignments where you present ideas from researched sources.
	- Do not write introductions or conclusions for the assignments. Get right to the point.
	- Do not discuss personal experiences or your thinking process unless the assignment explicitly tells you to. Avoid things like, "at first, I didn't know what this word meant, so I looked it up and it said..."

</details>

<details><summary> Not all exercises get individualized written feedback, but more can always be requested</summary>

- I provide most feedback on exercises during class discussion, as feedback is often useful for many students
- I read all exercise submissions thoroughly, even if they do not received significant individualized feedback
- You are always welcome to ask for additional feedback by scheduling a meeting with me.
