One day after you submit the final draft of Paper 2, submit a self-evaluation (max. 500 words) in the online text box that responds to the following questions:

- What revisions did you make to this paper since the draft we discussed during our consultation?
- In what ways do you think that the paper you are now submitting is an improvement over that draft?
- Were there additional changes you would like to have made for your final paper but weren't able to do so? What were these and why weren't you able to do so? (optional)
- What were the most important things you will take from this course?
