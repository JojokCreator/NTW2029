title: Exercise 03 - explain Boyd
---
<!-- Assignment 3 (due Sat 27 Jan 2024) -->

The goal of this exercise is to give you practice explaining (summarizing and explicating) a text. The reading comes from a popular science book, written by an academic, intended for a general audience. It was on the _New York Times_ bestseller list for many weeks (its popularity doesn't say anything about the quality or weakness of its arguments; I'm just trying to give you context for the intended reader). Your goal is to summarize the main points of the argument in one section (leaving out details not necessary for the reader to understand the argument) and explicate ideas, assumptions, and other elements that are crucial to the argument but are not clearly explained by Boyd.

You will summarize the first four pages (51-55) of Boyd's chapter, "The Evolution of Cooperation" in _On the Origin of Stories: Evolution, Cognition, and Fiction_. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2009. You do not need to read any crossed-out text.

Keep your submission under 500 words (but you do not need to make it that long; try to explain the passage in as few words as you can without omitting anything important).

Please review assignment guidelines, follow GenAI policy, and submit an updated workload report.
