<!-- Assignment 8 (due the day of your conference)â€”Paper 2 conference summary -->

Please submit a post-conference summary of the most important points you took from our conference and from my recorded comments on your draft. There is no word count requirement; I'll leave it up to you.

Your summary should include:

1. the most important points of feedback on your draft
2. your planned next steps for revising your draft
3. (optional) any other comments or feedback for me

After this conference, you can still email me specific questions. You can also request an in-person meeting and I'll do my best to accommodate you, time allowing. But remember that I am not able to provide general feedback on emailed drafts or paper sections.
