title: Exercise 06 - P1 self-evaluation

<!-- Assignment 6 (due [when?])â€”Paper 1 self-evaluation -->

One day after you submit the final draft of Paper 1, submit a self-evaluation (max. 500 words) that responds to the following questions:

- What revisions did you make to this paper since the draft we discussed during our consultation?
- In what ways do you think that the paper you are now submitting is an improvement over that draft?
- What do you plan to do differently when writing Paper 2, if anything? (optional)
- Were there additional changes you would like to have made for your final paper but weren't able to do so? What were these and why weren't you able to do so? (optional)

This exercise encourages you to critically reflect on your own writing process and gives you an opportunity to describe your progress and any difficulties you encountered along the way.
