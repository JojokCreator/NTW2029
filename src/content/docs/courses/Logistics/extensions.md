title: Extensions / Late submissions
---
_If you email me in advance_, any assignment, including final papers, may be submitted up to 24 hours late for any reason. Just email me before the deadline and say "I would like a 24 hour extension on [name of assignment]. I will submit it by [extended due date]." No further explanation is necessary.

Due to this policy, no additional extensions will be granted except in serious, documented circumstances.

Late submissions (past the original deadline or past any granted one-day extension) will incur a grade penalty.

Please do not ask for additional extensions for any of the following reasons:

- extracurricular activities or club obligations (NUS affiliated or not)
- travel or holiday
- assignments or exams for other courses

Of course, if you are having trouble managing your workload, please ask me or your RA for help. Do not put off asking for help because you hope the problem will solve itself. Act to prevent a small problem from becoming a big one.
