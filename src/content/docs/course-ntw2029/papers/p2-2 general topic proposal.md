<!-- Paper 2 general topic proposal -->

- Assignment goal: identify a topic area for your final paper.
- To help you find a source argument to analyze, you will first identify a general topic area about viewer response to film
- Propose two or more topic areas related to EP and art that you would be interested in writing about for your final paper. They can be stated as topics or questions. Briefly explain why you are interested in your topics or what about them interests you.
- Propose at least two topics to increase the chance that one of them will be suitable. I will provide feedback on your suggestions to guide you in the right direction
- Note: remember that you are not choosing a research question to answer, you are choosing a topic area to help you find a source you will enjoy analyzing.

Find out about existing research about EP and art to help you identify a topic that might interest you

<details><summary>A great way to get a sense of research in an area is to look at literature reviews</summary>

- most research articles summarize previous research in their introductions, to provide context regarding what other people have said in the academic conversation, and this section of an article is often referred to as a literature review
- however, there are also sources that are entirely literature reviews; they generally do not propose and defend theses but simply provide overviews of research in an area
- note: since they do not propose and defend theses, literature review sources are NOT appropriate as a primary source for paper 2

<details><summary> How can I tell if a source is a literature review? Clues include:</summary>

- it is a chapter in an anthology or a handbook
- anthologies
	- anthologies are books where each chapter is written by a different person
	- anthology chapters are sometimes, but not always, literature reviews
	- chapters in anthologies are independent and are related only by general topic area
	- handbooks list an editor or editors on the front cover rather than an author, e.g. "edited by Luicano Floridi"
	- the editor often writes a chapter of the book and is responsible for editing the chapters and managing the project
- handbook
	- handbooks are anthologies that aim to give researchers an overview of topics in a field, with each chapter about a different topic
		- handbook chapters are almost always literature reviews
	- handbooks usually have words like "handbook", "guide to", and "companion to" in their titles, as well as a publisher's name, e.g.:
		- _The Oxford handbook of philosophical methodology_
		- _The Palgrave handbook of the philosophy of film and motion pictures_
		- _The Routledge companion to video game studies_
		- _The Routledge handbook of evolution and philosophy_
		- _The Blackwell guide to the philosophy of computing and information_
- it has no clear "they say" that the source is arguing against, or the "they say" is something like "some people might think" but doesn't include any arguments against what other scholars have published
- it lists a number of different theories about a topic but doesn't clearly defend a particular theory

Some guidelines for topics:

- don't ask "why is X popular?"-we cannot know without market research
- the more modern or specific a genre is, the less likely its existence or features can be explained with EP (although some common responses to it might be explainable with EP)
- focus on more general and universal phenomena that are true of most people rather than more unusual or limited phenomena (e.g. the question "why doesn't my mom find horror movies scary" is an interesting question, but I assume is not one that someone has published research papers about).
- Format assignments correctly and update/upload your workload reports!
