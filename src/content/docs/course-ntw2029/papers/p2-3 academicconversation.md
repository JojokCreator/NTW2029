title: Paper 2
---

<!-- Paper 2 academic conversation overview -->

- To help you find a source argument to analyze, you will identify a general EP and art topic, find a specific academic conversation about that topic, pick a specific source contributing to that conversation, and (later) identify a part of that source argument to explain and analyze.
- For this assignment, identify an academic conversation relevant to EP and art that is discussed in published academic sources.
	- In addition to the literature review texts listed in the last Paper 2 assignment, you can look at the sources listed below.
	- Start looking for these at the NUS library website rather than general online searches. Ask an NUS librarian if you cannot access them through the library webpage. If you can't get them through the library in a timely manner, ask your tech savvy friends for a potential workaround.
	- articles in the journal [_Evolutionary Studies in Imaginative Culture_](https://linc.nus.edu.sg/record=b4345340)
	- Texts relevant to specific topic areas
		- You can choose one of these texts as your primary source (no promises from me that they will work for you; you are responsible for making sure the source is suitable for your paper) or use them as a starting place to find related sources.
		- I have put a @ in front of sources that other students have already written about in previous terms, so for those I suggest that you take them as a starting place for your search and use them to find related sources

- Identify at least 2 academic sources that are part of this conversation and that you might analyze for Paper 2. Provide their full citation information as if in an APA reference list.
	- You can review what counts as an academic source in the Paper 2 basic overview.
	- Provide full citation information for each text and provide a link to the text, either to the full article or a link to the book on the publisher's website or the NUS library page.
- Briefly describe the academic conversation and what your sources have contributed to it. The description can be high-level (meaning you don't need to provide details of their arguments) but must make clear how the two sources differ in their contributions.
- At the end of this description, skip a line and state which of the sources you discuss you propose as your main focus for Paper 2. I will approve the source (or not) and you will use that source for the next part of the assignment, the Paper 2 Source Summary.
	- My approval means that I don't see any obvious problems with using your source, but won't be able to read all of your sources closely at this point, so I cannot take responsibility for making sure the source will work well for Paper 2. That is your responsibility.
- You can change your main text later if necessary, but I strongly recommend that you stay within the same basic topic area so you don't spend lots of time looking for the perfect text. Any source changes must be approved.
