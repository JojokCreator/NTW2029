title: Exercise 10 - Workload report
date: 2024-08-13

---

Instructors are told that this course should require an average of 10 hours of work per week, and I want to make sure I am within that guideline. I need your help to make sure I'm meeting this goal.

Please download the [:workload log](/public/downloads/2410%20NTW2029workload.docx), save it, and [:log your time](#x-estimate) it in weekly [:in hours](#x-hours). Include both reading and [:writing](#x-writing) assignments.

The log lists assignments and class meeting "preparation", which includes reading, notes, viewing, and anything else you do for class outside of the assignments.

The amount of time you spend on this course will not affect your grade in any way, including your participation grade. I am just collecting data.

# :x estimate

It is fine if your data is not accurate; just make your best estimates.

# :x hours

Report your time in hours, using numbers only (use "2" not "2 hrs"), rounding to the nearest half hour (0.5).

# :x writing

For writing assignments, when you estimate time, _include_ time spent reading Canvas, reading sources, getting feedback on assignments from people, etc.
