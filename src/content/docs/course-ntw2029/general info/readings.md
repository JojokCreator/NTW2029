## Reading guidelines

- Readings are listed on the day they will be discussed in class. They are not assignments for the following class meeting. Do the readings by the day they are listed.
- Please obtain access to the following books on writing, which are sometimes assigned as recommended reading:
	- _They Say / I Say_ (or TSIS) is Graff, Gerald, and Cathy Birkenstein. _"They Say / I Say": The Moves That Matter in Academic Writing_. 3rd ed. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2014.
	- _The Craft of Research_ (or COR) is Booth, Wayne C., Gregory G. Colomb, Joseph M. Williams, Joseph Bizup, and William T. FitzGerald. _The Craft of Research_. 4th ed. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 2016.
- Except for the two books on writing, all readings will be provided both as printouts (distributed in class) and in pdf form through links in the reading assignments. Please bring the printouts of the assigned readings to class. Due to my electronics policy, you will not be able to access the readings in class on your phones or laptops.
- If you miss class, please arrange to have a classmate take a hardcopy of the reading to give to you later.
- You do not have to bring physical copies of the books on writing to class.
