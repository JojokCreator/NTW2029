<!-- Paper 2 source outline -->

Note: in addition to submitting here, email your outline to your group members Wed night before class 10.2 (they're listed on the 10.2 page).

Assignment purpose:

- This assignment helps you understand the main claims and structure of your source. To Paper 2 requires you to analyze a source argument, and the first step is understanding the argument.
- For this assignment, do your best to provide a summary of your main source in outline form, following the detailed instructions below
- First, look at a [sample outline here](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/users/90279/files/3878218/download?verifier=xTVJPZcQmMOFBnsfaQ67UmlpkJEEP0FrANrDqjkm&download_frd=1) because it will make the following instructions much easier to understand.

Logistics:

- Put the citation for your source at the top as your title. Then, paraphrase the paper's main thesis. Then, outline the source using these instructions.
- Try to limit your summary to one printed page, single-spaced,  to make sure you are not going into too much detail (this is impossible for some longer papers).
- Submit this assignment as an attached file.
- Bring 4 hardcopies of this source to class 10.2.

Outline structure:

- If your source has sections or other internal structure, I suggest you use that structure as a starting point for your summary; otherwise, you will decide an appropriate outline structure.
	- One note: sometimes papers start with an introduction but don't label it with a heading. In this case, in your outline, add "Introduction: " to your the first main point to make things clearer.
- If your paper has section headings that are not full sentences, you can put those headings before your main points, but follow them with a statement that summarizes the main point of that section.
	- e.g. theoretical paper: "3. Cave Music: Evidence suggests that early humans played drums in groups."
	- e.g. empirical research paper: "3. Method: the experiment asked subjects to watch a film and comment on their thoughts during viewing."
- Note: science papers do not put their conclusions in the beginning as a thesis. They put hypotheses in the beginning and then tell you whether they think they proved their hypotheses in the Discussion and Conclusion sections. Thus, you will have to look at those sections to find the thesis that you will state at the top of your outline.

Strategy:

- Do not focus on being comprehensive (i.e., including every argument in the source or making sure every paragraph is represented in the outline). There might be paragraphs or arguments in the source that are not really relevant to the source thesis, and you should not include these in your outline. Instead, focus on capturing the main points of the argument. To identify those main points and differentiate them from other parts of the source, you should try to understand the argumentative structure of the source. Ask yourself questions such as:
	- What is the academic conversation this source is contributing to?
	- What is the main question the source aims to answer?
	- What new ideas does the source claim it is adding to the conversation?
	- What is the main thesis of the source?
	- What are the main points supporting that thesis?
	- What kind of examples or evidence does the source use, and what function do they serve?
	- What does the source seem to care most about? What is motivating them to write this essay?
	- Who is the source arguing against?
- IMPORTANT: don't answer the above questions in your assignment. Their purpose is to help you identify the overall structure of the source argument, which will help you better identify the main claims that you will summarize in your outline. The outline should summarize the source's main claims in complete sentences in a hierarchy that reflects the argumentative structure.

Write the assignment in the following detailed, restrictive way that tries to help you force yourself to deal with the source now rather than later:

- State the source's thesis at the top (2 sentences maximum, but aim for 1).
- Do not include source quotations. Use paraphrases only. Put the page number or range for each point at the end of that point. e.g. (22-23).
- Put a properly APA-formatted reference list after the outline. It will include only one source for this assignment.
- For this assignment, your points will be written in the voice of the source, so instead of "Boyd says that cooperation evolved..." you just write "Cooperation evolved...".
- Follow the thesis with numbered/lettered lines in a hierarchical outline form. The exact number/letter scheme doesn't matter, but make sure each line has a unique indicator so it's easy for people to refer to. In this assignment, I'll call each numbered/lettered part of the outline a "point", but "point" refers to an indicator followed by sentence, not an idea in a general sense. (A point would be: "3a. Boyd claims that this experiment shows that cooperation is heritable.").
- Each numbered point is called a "main point" and lettered points indented underneath main points are "subpoints", and "point" without an adjective refers to both. You will have 2 to 5 main points in the outline.
- Each point will paraphrase a claim from the source argument.
- Each point in the outline should contain EXACTLY one complete sentence--not two or more sentences. Do not use more than one sentence per point in any circumstance.
	- Correct:
		- 1. Dance movements convey sex-specific information indicating an individual's biological quality (352).
			- A. Male physical strength may be a mating-related quality conveyed through dance as more elaborate dance movements are challenging and require a higher level of coordination to be executed (352-353).
			- B. In contrast, female dance movements may provide information about their fertility (353).
- Each point should be a COMPLETE sentence with a clear subject and verb, ending in a period—not a phrase or sentence fragment.
	- Avoid: "Adaptive traits from the EEA" [not a sentence]
	- Avoid: "What happens in modern society." [not a sentence]
	- Avoid:
		- 2. Action films and video games teach coping by:
			- a) Balancing negative and positive experiences and creating a hierarchy among them.
			- b) Integrating negative emotions into positive goals to pose activating challenges.
		- Problem: (1) is not a complete sentence by itself. (A) and (B) are not complete sentences by themselves. The incorrect format encourages the student to make a list of points without really summarizing them into increasingly broad ideas.
- The subject of your point sentences should NOT be the source author, but a thing the author talks about (an idea or another author).
	- This is very important! If you don't follow this rule you will likely end up describing the source as a piece of writing rather than actually summarizing its argument.
	- Avoid:
		- 3. The authors of this study assume that musicality is universal in human vocal communication.
			- a. To overcome the cultural variation in music, the authors focus on the universality of musicality since it's a product of our brain's physiology and psychology. (2)
		- Problem: both points describe the assumptions or actions of the authors. Possible correction: (1) Musicality is universal in human vocal communication, (a) Despite the cultural variation in music, the universality of music can be explained because music is a product of humans' evolved brains.
- Avoid using "this" or "it" as the subject of the points
	- Avoid: "This is an example of mate selection." [What is an example of mate selection? Identify it clearly.]
- Each point should be a STATEMENT—not a question.
	- Avoid: "What does survival have to do with sexual selection?" [not a statement]
- Each point should make a claim about your TOPIC, it should NOT make a claim about what the source does in the paper. Yes, I am repeating this same point with additional examples because this guideline is so important.
	- Avoid: "Boyd gives several supporting examples."
	- Correct: "One modern mechanism for punishing cheaters is a police force." (stating the example)
	- Avoid: "Pinker gives several reasons that music is pleasurable."
	- Correct: "Music includes sounds similar to those found in the EEA" (written as if you are Pinker making this argument)
- Do NOT include MORE than 3 subpoints per main point. If you have 4 or more subpoints, you are likely listing a number of related claims in the order the author makes them rather than actually summarizing ideas into larger and larger units.
- Do not include lines about the paper introduction or conclusion in the outline. The thesis stated above the outline will serve as the introduction to the outline.
- Keyterms: Look for any central concepts in your source argument and the key terms used to reflect them. If your outline uses these key terms, you may want to have a definition of one or more of these terms as a subpoint in your outline.
- This assignment isn't easy, but don't stress about getting it perfect. I am forcing you to start now so we have more time later to draft and revise the paper.

Recommended method for understanding the argument

- Since you have now read your source and have a good general understanding of its argument, you now need to gain a more detailed understanding of the overall argument. Note that this is a step before you actually identify a specific part of the argument to explain and analyze.
- The following is my suggestion for how to take notes on the source to gain that understanding. It is how I do it, but (fair warning) it is not the only way, and it may not work for you. Note that this section describes a way to take notes, not how to write the final assignment you will submit.
	- This approach is not needed for every source you take notes on, just ones you want to closely analyze.
	- My general approach for detailed notetaking is the opposite of drafting: you start with small pieces and abstract from them into larger ideas. With drafting your essay, you (ideally) start with more abstract claims and flesh them out into detailed explanations.
- Go through the source and, for each paragraph, in your own words, paraphrase the main idea the reader is supposed to get from that paragraph that one paragraph in a complete sentence. Often, this idea does not match any one particular sentence in the source.
- Make sure your paraphrase is a complete sentence (not a sentence fragment or a topic phrase) that captures the entire main idea of the paragraph. I do NOT mean the paraphrase it captures all of the details; that would be impossible. I mean that the paraphrase should not just restate one idea that is in the paragraph; it must convey the entire main idea (i.e. capture all of the important parts) while ignoring details that the source uses to support the main idea.
- It is _very important_ that the paraphrase is a complete sentence, not a topic or a sentence fragment, in order to force yourself to do the work needed to understand the paragraph.
- Sometimes the main idea will be quite specific, such as "This study assumes that volume of lacrimal production is an accurate proxy of sadness." Other times, the main idea might be fairly general, such as "There are many ways scholars have studied emotion" (this paragraph might list 10 different ways scholars have studied emotion, but those details are likely not important in paraphrasing the main idea).
- When you have worked through a section of the paper or the whole paper, summarize groups of paragraphs at a higher level of abstraction: "chunk" the paper into pieces larger than one paragraph each by grouping 3-5 paraphrases together and summarizing them into one larger claim. I'm not saying you combine these statements into one long sentence that captures everything in all of them. I'm saying you need to think abstractly about the main point of this "chunk" of the paper and write that main point in your own words. Again, you will likely need to leave out some content that, at this level, is detail unnecessary to understanding the main idea of this 3-5 paragraph section. That detail is still probably quite important in the argument, of course, in supporting the main idea and convincing the reader that this idea is true; it is just not essential for understanding what the main idea is or what this section claims.
- Keep repeating this process until you have paraphrases of the paper's main ideas that include just 3-5 main points. The number of hierarchical "levels" you have will depend on your source, but probably no more three in most cases.
- If your source has section headings, you can use these to help you organize and group your paraphrased points. If not, you will have to figure out how to best group the paragraphs.
- You should now have a clear idea of the source argument thesis, main points, and the subpoints (and sub-subpoints, etc.) that support the argument.
- It may be that your source argument is easier to understand if the points are reorganized. These instructions don't include that step, but I encourage you to do this if it makes the argument easier to undestand. You will have to do it later anyway when explaining the argument in your paper.
