<!-- Paper 2 general proposal -->

Submit 2 topics related to EP and art that you would be interested in writing about. They can be stated as topics or questions. Aim for a topic that would cover a group of papers in an academic conversation. You can look at sources mentioned in next week's assignment to give you ideas, but this is not required. Briefly explain why you are interested in your topics or what about them interests you.

Submit TWO topics to increase the chance that one of them will be suitable.

Some guidelines:

- don't ask "why is X popular?"â€”we cannot know without market research
- the more modern or specific a genre is, the less likely its existence or features can be explained with EP (although some common responses to it might be explainable with EP)
- focus on more general and universal phenomena that are true of most people rather than more unusual or limited phenomena (e.g. the question "why doesn't my mom find horror movies scary" is an interesting question, but I assume is not one that someone has published research papers about).
