Getting a yoyo to sleep means keeping it spinning at the end of its string without coming back up. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Hold the Yoyo Properly**: First, make sure the string is securely attached to your middle finger, about halfway between your first knuckle and the tip of your finger. This helps you control the yoyo better.

2. **Grip the Yoyo**: Hold the yoyo in your hand with your palm facing up. The yoyo should be sitting in your hand with the string coming off the top towards your body.

3. **Throwing Motion**: To get the yoyo to sleep, you need a strong and straight throw. Hold your arm out straight in front of you, then bring the yoyo back up to your shoulder. Quickly and smoothly extend your arm down and out, flicking your wrist as you release the yoyo. Imagine you're trying to throw it straight down to the ground.

4. **Releasing the Yoyo**: As you release the yoyo, snap your wrist so that the yoyo spins as it goes down. This spin is what keeps the yoyo sleeping. The harder you throw, the longer it will sleep.

5. **Allow It to Spin**: Once the yoyo reaches the end of the string, it should be spinning rapidly. Keep your hand steady and slightly above the yoyo to maintain tension on the string, which helps keep it spinning. Don't move your hand too much; let the yoyo do the work.

6. **Bring It Back Up**: To wake the yoyo (make it return to your hand), give a slight tug on the string. This tug makes the yoyo climb back up the string and return to your hand.

With practice, you'll get better at throwing the yoyo harder and straighter, making it sleep longer. Remember, the key is a smooth, strong throw and keeping your hand steady while it spins.
